Style Summary for AI Continuation

1. Centralized CSS Variables:
- Created a variables.css file defining colors, fonts, spacing, and other design tokens as CSS variables.
- All component styles reference these variables for consistent theming and easy updates.

2. Modular CSS Files:
- Each React component or feature has its own dedicated CSS file (e.g., AuthEntry.css, LoginForm.css, CandidatePortal.css, ClientPortal.css, Marketplace.css, Header.css, Layout.css).
- CSS files are imported directly into their corresponding component files.

3. Layout and Structure:
- A Layout component wraps pages, including a fixed Header and main content area.
- Added top padding to main content to account for fixed header height, preventing content overlap.
- Used flexbox and grid layouts with clear gap and alignment settings.

4. Naming Conventions:
- Used descriptive, scoped class names to avoid conflicts (e.g., .auth-entry-container, .candidate-portal-button).
- Followed a BEM-like pattern for clarity.

5. Responsive and Accessible Design:
- Used relative units (rem, em, %) and CSS variables for sizing and spacing.
- Included media queries for light/dark mode color adjustments.
- Ensured focus styles and semantic HTML elements for accessibility.

6. Buttons and Interactive Elements:
- Consistent button styles with padding, border-radius, font-weight, and colors.
- Hover and focus states use CSS variables.
- Cursor pointer and smooth transitions for better UX.

7. Text and Typography:
- System fonts and consistent font sizes/weights.
- Handled text overflow with word-wrap, white-space, and text-overflow properties.

8. Specific Component Styles:
- AuthEntry: Centered container with buttons styled using CSS variables.
- LoginForm & SignupForm: Centered forms with inputs, selects, and buttons styled consistently.
- CandidatePortal & ClientPortal: Dashboard layouts with styled buttons, messages, navigation, and entity lists.
- Marketplace: Sidebar filters and main content with header, search, grid/list of items, and pagination styled modularly.
- Header: Fixed full-width header with right-aligned navigation and logout button.
